Todo for garble web  ( mark with 'x' when fixed)
---

#Main 
[] - Clean up all the useless code that violates DRY  ( don't reapeat yourself )
[] - clean up the code for selecting levels by using a single function 
[] - add json file for level data
[] - add documentation 

#Issues
[] - there's still alot of confusion on which type of input I expect from the user ( touch screen, typed etc)
[] - Interface doesn't show on github pages. 
[] - Dashes are drawn vertically out of the sight of the player
when hosted on GH pages; Hosted locally, they aren't presenting half of the dashes 
and the player can't even scroll to see them
