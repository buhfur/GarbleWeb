======================================
        Random notes 
======================================

 - the letter buttons will shift closer together and change the size of the footer
 which is really annoying. need to fix

- change the design of the game where there are only 3 game modes. normal, random, and endless
- normal follows a normal path of levels 1-5 with the game incrementing every time 
- also should add a little instructional message before the user plays the game
